# Mental Health Helper
Helping Hand is a mental health web application with variety of features and elements all in one that provides users with what they need in order to help and improve their mental health. It's in our understanding that mental Health challenges is a problem a majority of the world's population faces. However, society stills struggles to put more emphasis on taking care of one's mental health, when it is just as important as physical health. Due to the lack of resources that may be available for people to monitor their mental health, it can be hard to find solutions when facing such problems. That's why we wanted to create a safe space for those in need of proper help and attention. Our website aims to provide various resources and awareness to assist people in understanding and coping with mental challenges. We aim to help everyone, no matter their identity, because mental health isn't limited to any certain person.
